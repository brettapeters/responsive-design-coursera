<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>For this assessment you should create a data driven website that uses html, css, JavaScript and templates to display some data. This data will be some creative commons material taken from wikipedia about different animals.</p>
    <p>You can find a zip file <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/Jackie%27s%20folder/Assignment.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a> that contains everything you need to start: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the JavaScript and css libraries you might need (jquery, bootstrap, handlebars)</li>
        <li>empty JavaScript and CSS files to put your code in</li>
        <li>a HTML file with a head that imports the libraries, JavaScript and css files and an empty body to put your HTML code in</li>
        <li>a JavaScript file called AnimalsData.js which contains the data you will be displaying</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AnimalsData.js contains a single variable called “animals_data”. This variable is an object that contains an array called “category”. Each element in the array represents a class of animals (reptiles, mammals, birds) and it contains
        a name and another array called “animals” which contains objects representing species of animal. Each object has the following member variables: </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>name; the name of the species</li>
        <li>description: a textual description of the species</li>
        <li>image1: an image of an example of the species</li>
        <li>image2: a second, alternative, image</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>You should create the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A HTML file containing the structures of your page, including templates designed to display the data</li>
        <li>A JavaScript file that maps the data onto the templates and provides any interactivity</li>
        <li>A CSS file that styles the web site (you may optionally use bootstrap).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The layout of the site should be appropriate to the data and display it in a clear and understandable way. It should provide suitable navigation functions and the overall layout and design should reflect the guidelines we have described
        in this MOOC.</p>
    <p>You should submit a zip file containing everything you need to run the website, including the original data file, an html file, a css file and a JavaScript file, as well as any images and other files you need (including JavaScript
        libraries such as jquery, handlebars and bootstrap.</p>
    <p>You are required to review 3 of your peers in order to receive a grade.</p>
